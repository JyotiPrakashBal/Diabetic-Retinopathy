# Diabetic Retinopathy
Diabetic retinopathy (DR), also known as diabetic eye disease, is a medical condition in which damage occurs to the retina due to diabetes mellitus. It is a leading cause of blindness. Diabetic retinopathy affects up to 80 percent of those who have had diabetes for 20 years or more. Diabetic retinopathy often has no early warning signs. Retinal (fundus) photography with manual interpretation is a widely accepted screening tool for diabetic retinopathy, with performance that can exceed that of in-person dilated eye examinations. </br></br>
An automated tool for grading severity of diabetic retinopathy would be very useful for accerelating detection and treatment. Recently, there have been a number of attempts to utilize deep learning to diagnose DR and automatically grade diabetic retinopathy. This includes a previous competition and work by Google. Even one deep-learning based system is FDA approved. </br> </br>
A clinician has rated the presence of diabetic retinopathy in each image on a scale of 0 to 4, according to the following scale:

0 - No DR

1 - Mild

2 - Moderate

3 - Severe

4 - Proliferative DR
